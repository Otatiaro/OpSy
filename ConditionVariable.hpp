 * @version V0.1
 * @date    01-March-2019
 * @brief   Replacement for @c std::condition_variable
 *
 * 		 Compared to @c std::condition_variable:
 * 		  - uses only the @c Mutex class
 * 		  - has @c wait, @c wait_for and @c wait_until without @c Mutex
 * 		  - uses @c duration and @c time_point for time expressions
 * 		  - uses a @c Mutex for @c notify and @c notify_all synchronization
 * 		  - does not generate spurious notifications, hence there is no
 * 		    method with check predicates
