 * @brief   Default (empty) hooks for OpSy
 *
 * 			This class is a default (empty) implementation of the hooks
 * 			used by OpSy. All methods are @c static @c constexpr @c void and
 * 			empty, so that starting at Og all calls to these are removed by
 * 			the compiler.
 *
 * 			You can redirect these calls to a custom implementation by creating
 * 			a file OpsyHooks.hpp in one of the include directory of the project.
 *
 * 			You can then add custom checks and code, e.g. for integration of a
 * 			monitoring tool like SEGGER SystemView.
