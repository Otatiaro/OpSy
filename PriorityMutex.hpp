 * @version V0.1
 * @date    01-March-2019
 * @brief   Replacement for @c std::mutex
 *
 *			It is based on:
 *			 - critical sections for @c Task only exclusion
 *			 - @c BASEPRI register (interrupt masking) for interrupt service
 *			 routine exclusion
 *
 *			It is a @c BasicLockable type, which means it only has @c lock and
 *			@c unlock.
 *			These cannot fail. Moreover, they are guaranteed to be lock free.
 *
 *			It is not copy constructible not copy assignable, only move
 *			constructible and assignable.
