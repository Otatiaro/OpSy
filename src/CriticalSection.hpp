 * @version V0.1
 * @date    01-March-2019
 * @brief   An object representing a lock on a critical section
 *
 * 			When a @c Task has a lock on a critical section, this prevents
 * 			the @c Scheduler from changing the current task.
 * 			A valid @c CriticalSection can only be created by @c Scheduler
 *
 * 			Obviously, do not call blocking features with an active
 * 			critical section (other than @c ConditionVariable wait)
 *
 * 			This object is not copy constructible or copy assignable, only
 * 			move constructible and move assignable.
 *
 * 			This ensures the lock will be released when the object is discarded
